I might start with the most basic answer ever but, just personal stuff mostly. I, obviously, didn't just stop making new stuff, but I had found myself being unable to be happy with the results.

The most obvious answer to why I haven't released any of my completed songs either is art. I'm a pretty reserved person, despite loving speaking my mind, I only work by myself on any of the projects I take. 

This inevitably slows down releases once I work on one thing, but then realize I have to do the rest myself. Because of this, I've found myself picking a whole lot of skills!
I'm pretty happy with how my current art looks, and my music has certainly become better!

###### I also just have a small fear of releasing something bad in quality.

With this website though, I hope to achieve at the very least, a place where I can speak my mind.
I often find myself being unable to post anything personal anywhere else because, well, most online platforms just don't feel right to be posting that type of stuff on.

Putting the explanation aside, let's get to what I've been working on!

### Projects I can talk about somewhere finally!

To cut to the chase on the project I've dedicated the most time to, It would be my new _planned_ web series, _**"Roblox Retake!"**_
Now, if you've taken a look at the other parts of my website, then you would've read the little rundown I have on it. If you haven't on the other hand, I'll summarize!
"Roblox Retake" is a planned web series where I give my "Roblox-ified" take on a given character and their respective FNF song. Think of "Mario Mix" or "Roblox Mix" (My main inspiration!) and that would be what I'm doing.
Now you may wonder why I don't just ask to work on the official "Roblox Mix," or just make my own original stuff. The answers to those two questions are:

1. I don't think I'm _that_ good at music or art, let alone where to even ask to join.
2. I like Roblox, and I definitely plan to do _original_ stuff, to an extent. Making fan creations is also just **really** easy.

Putting that aside, you may also wonder about the other project I happened to show off on this website.
That project is very **secretive** for now, so I won't share any more details on its story or characters. Perhaps soon if I pick up my slack a certain _video_ can release soon showing off some cool stuff!

##### That's it for now!
Thanks for stopping by and reading this post! I'll try to be consistent with the 2-3 day schedule I promised in my community post. If I can't get _**anything**_ out then I'll be sure to notify within a blog post saying I'm busy for a while.
Hope I see you soon again here!
