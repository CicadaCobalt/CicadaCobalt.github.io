description: I explain where I went for a week, and current progress on "Roblox Retake."

I should probably start with explaining the site’s blog gap, the (about) two week gap in between posts.

It started with me just not having anything to really post about, and snowballed into me forgetting I had this site up. Then I remembered today, and now I have stuff to talk about.
I should mention, that I don’t do much outside of the internet (socially speaking) so I usually get things done fast.

I say usually because “Roblox Retake” has been eating away at **loads** of time.
Now you may wonder why, and I would too, but here’s the thing; from the start my number one goal with music was to capture the insane ideas I had for FNF songs, and I hadn’t really been doing that.
With my most recent song however (Roblox Retake’s first song upload), I told myself ”“This won’t be another basic visualizer people make in like a hour.”
So I’ve been working away to make some visuals that’ll really blow people away! Since I refuse to work with others (mostly because I find it hard to talk to others online), this means this has taken me extra long to release anything.
Luckily enough, since I don’t have a social life (not too sure if I should say luckily), I have plenty of time to daydream the stories I wish to tell with my songs!
For those curious what I mean by “stories,” fear not I have a explanation! I mean the lore of my characters, and also what takes place in their songs.

Currently thanks to this, I have (give or take) about five characters completed! Writing has been something I also enjoy, and while I don’t practice it much, writing these character’s stories helps me practice.
Song wise I have one song fully done (working on visuals as of the moment), and another song near completion (vocals need to be completed, along with visuals).
I won’t lie, I’ve stagnated a little music-wise. This stems from a lot of the songs I like not being _that_ different tone wise. So with my “Retakes” I’m planning to **really** switch things up.
I’m not completely just making new songs, I will be using a similar vibe, and concept-wise the retake will be very close to the original.

As a little bonus for reading to the end of this particular post I’ll just announce that I’m reusing ”“Empty Fate” for the ”“Fake Baby” ”“Retake!”
Thanks for reading!
