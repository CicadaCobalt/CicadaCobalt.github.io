                <h2> Hello! Welcome to my website!</h2>

                <p> This is the welcome page! It also functions as an about me page, so my introduction is below!</p>
                <p> Hello to everyone that reads this! I'm Cobalt, otherwise known as CicadaCobalt. I've gone by other names at various points in my online life, but those are embarrassing...</p>
                <p> Getting back on track here, I have lots of hobbies! Those are what this site is dedicated to!</p>

                <p> I absolutely love creating things, a lot of my hobbies are centered around creating! I like composing music, drawing, coding, and writing! I like doing these, but am I good at them? I'm probably not, but I won't decide that...</p>
                
                <p> I'm pretty reserved, I don't often interact with things I like online directly... That being said, I don't mind anyone talking to me if they want to! My handle online is @CicadaCobalt pretty much everywhere. I have direct messages on everywhere that lets me, so feel free to contact me for whatever!</p>
                <p> I'll try my best to maintain this website when I can, but I probably won't update here too often... I've gotta work on my other projects afterall!</p>
