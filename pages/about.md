# The classic about me page!

### Who am I?
I am a aspiring artist on the internet. By that I mean I hope to make art of all kinds! Digital, traditional, music, games, stories, and probably more.

I am _quite reserved_ when it comes to interaction online, so you probably won't see me post publicly too often...

Currently some of my main passions are located within games I play like Roblox and Friday Night Funkin'!

### Where can you find me?
I use the handle CicadaCobalt, pretty random set of words I came up with but it's available everywhere!

I use the nickname **Cobalt** though, so that'll be my display name more often than not.

Notable places you can find me on are: YouTube, Roblox, Soundcloud, and this very website!

### Where should I contact you?
Although I doubt this will be a real question, I'll answer it here just in case. The best place to contact me, as of this moment, is **Discord**. My handle on Discord is _**@cicadacobalt!**_
