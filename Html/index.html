                    Hello! Welcome to my website!
                </h3>

                Since this page functions as a "About me" too, I should get to introducing myself! <br>
                <p>
                    I am CicadaCobalt, or otherwise known as Cobalt! I've been on the net for a while now, I've only recently begun to make my mark online.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I have a boatload of hobbies because I love learning! I've always had a knack for picking up information pretty quick. Some hobbies I have are: composing music, drawing, 3D modeling, programming, and writing. Still though, I want to continue learning! I plan on picking up carpentry as a hobby pretty soon. I've always loved creating things so it comes as no supprise that all of my hobbies are centered around creatiing things.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Currently I actually don't have very many interests outside of my hobbies. I rarely play games anymore unless it's something with my one friend... Some how through all of that, I've managed to keep two major interests of mine. Those being Friday Night Funkin' and Roblox!
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    Speaking a little personally here, I don't have very many friends. Real life and online. That's probably why I have the time to pickup as many hobbies as I have. If you want to chat with me feel free to send me a direct message on Discord! My handle is @CicadaCobalt anywhere I can get my hands on it!
                </p>
                <p>
                    I'll try my best to maintain this website when I can, but I probably won't update here too often...
                </p>
