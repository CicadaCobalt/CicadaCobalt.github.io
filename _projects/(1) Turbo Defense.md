## What is this?

This is a tower defense game _about_ three years in the making. Sadly, as of this moment (2025), this project remains on my backburner when it comes to coding...

## Why is that?

This is mostly because I've been working all my other FNF projects, and those consume a lot of time and energy. When it comes to story though, I'm still creating!

## What's the story look like?

This game is slated to take place in a alternate Earth with some Roblox ideas thrown into the mix. You will play as the Commander, a prodigy, and a ruthless machine on the battle field. You, as the commander, learn the meaning of what it means to be human again in a sense.

You'll meet intriguing characters, and villains proving to be **stronger** than you.

## What's the gameplay look like?

This game's gameplay is a melting pot of ideas. I mainly play one _certain_ game, which has influenced a lot of the features I plan to add.

I plan for the game to have a central open world, allowing for a small amount of exploration, along with a central tower defense game loop. Throw in some other interesting features (Npc's, gacha-like character unlocking, and other smaller bits!), and you have the game.

## What might be a plausible release date?

Sadly, I don't have one. This game is a solo project to me, so it probably won't _ever_ come out. That certainly doesn't mean I won't try to push it out, but it means that when I do, it will be years from now.
